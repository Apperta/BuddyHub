#Information about the MomgoDB database#

The database is hosed on Amazon AWS, and its public DNS address is hardcoded into backend.js with log-on string. 
To authenticate log-on, create a file called "auth.json" in the same directory with log-on detail which I will announce elseware *wink wink*

**Remember to untrack the json file from git if it is tracked!**
