# BuddyHub
### A Universal Controller Platform for Assistive Technology
**BuddyHub is an Open Source platform that leverages the Internet of Things to allow people with different disabilities to control various output devices in their environment via accesible inputs through a simple-to-navigate and user-friendly interface.**

BuddyHub was born out of a joint collaboration between Imperial College London and Wooden Spoon: The Children's Charity of Rugby, the latter of whom invests heavily in assistive technologies and aims to promote their development and make them more accessible to end users.
