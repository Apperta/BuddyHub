# BuddyHub
### The Universal Controller Platform for Assistive Technology
**BuddyHub is a free and open-source platform that leverages the Internet of Things (IoT) to allow people with different disabilities to control various output devices in their environment via accesible inputs through a simple-to-navigate and user-friendly interface.**

## About
BuddyHub was born out of a joint collaboration between Imperial College London and Wooden Spoon: The Children's Charity of Rugby, the latter of whom invests heavily in assistive technologies and aims to promote their development and make them more accessible to end users.

BuddyHub aims to be an affordable, end-to-end solution for people with disabilities to utilize smart devices in their surroundings through a variety of accessible input devices that caters to their individual needs in a plug-and-play fashion. This is all done through the user interface of BuddyHub, which was designed with a special needs audience in mind. For instance, a user with limited motion capabilities could control smart appliances, robotic arms and other forms of hardware they might need, as long as they are integrated into BuddyHub's system.

This project also aims to promote the development of assistive technology by providing a platform for developers and companies to build on and integrate their products with. The ultimate goal is to make such technologies more affordable as well as integrate them with the Internet of Things for the benefit of end users. As more devices become interconnected, this universal controller platform can act as a central hub of control for these devices, giving users with various disabilities the ability to utilize a wide range of devices that cater to their individual needs.

The team that developed the platform focused on establishing the groundwork and software architecture to achieve the above goals. The first iteration of the product demonstrates the viability and usefulness of such a universal and accessible software platform that can be used for controlling technologies in a familiar and easy manner by people with disabilities. Due to time constraints, not all features we wanted to implement / issues we wanted to fix were resolved; the team hopes that a community of developers / other students could collaborate and improve on what has been done so far.

## Installation and Setup
BuddyHub currently has a web and desktop (Windows) version, both of which are functional and augment the intent of having a user-friendly and accessible UI for end users.

To access the web version of BuddyHub, please visit [BuddyHub (Web)](https://wsurop18-universal-controller.herokuapp.com/).

To install the Windows version, follow the steps below:
* One
* Two
* Three

## List of Compatible Devices (Updated: 30/8/18)
To demonstrate the universal plug-and-play capabilities of the prototype that the team developed, we cross-tested the universal controller platform with the following input and output devices:

### Input Devices:
* Tobi Eyetracker
* Most accesible joysticks (we used ...)
* 

### Output Devices:
* Web-based Voice Synthesizer for Alexa (allows a user with limited vocal capabilities to interact with Alexa through BuddyHub)
* Philips Hue Go ([API Documentation](https://www.developers.meethue.com/documentation/getting-started))
* Robotic arm (we wrote a C# web API and wrapper to interact with the robotic arm's native C# firmware)
