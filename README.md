# BuddyHub
### A Universal Controller Platform for Assistive Technology
**BuddyHub is an Open Source platform that leverages the Internet of Things to allow people with different disabilities to control various output devices in their environment via accesible inputs through a simple-to-navigate and user-friendly interface.**

BuddyHub was born out of a join collaboration between Imperial College London and Wooden Spoon: The Children's Charity of Rugby, the latter of whom invests heavily in assistive technologies and aims to promote the development of such technologies and make them more accessible to end users.
